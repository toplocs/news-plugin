const selectedTags = ref<string[]>([])
const uploadedImage = ref<string>('')
const expandedComments = ref<Set<string>>(new Set())
```

**New Computed Properties:**

const tagCounts = computed(() => {...})      // Tag → count mapping
const filteredPosts = computed(() => {...})  // Filter by selected tags
```

**New Functions:**
- `handleSearch(query)` - Search posts by title/content

- `handleCommentAdded(postId)` - Increment comment count

**Template Changes:**
```vue
<!-- Header with Search -->
<SearchBar @search="handleSearch" @select="handleSearchSelect" />

<!-- Tag Filter -->
<TagFilter
  :available-tags="availableTags"
  :tag-counts="tagCounts"
  @update:selected-tags="handleTagsUpdate"
/>

<!-- Create Post Modal with Image Upload -->
<ImageUpload @image-selected="handleImageSelected" />

<!-- Loading Skeleton -->
<LoadingSkeleton v-if="loading" type="post" :count="3" />

<!-- Post Card with all new features -->
<div v-for="post in sortedPosts" :data-post-id="post.id">
  <!-- Online Status -->
  <OnlineStatus status="online" />

  <!-- Save Button -->
  <button @click="handleSavePost(post)">
    {{ isPostSaved(post.id) ? '💾' : '🔖' }}
  </button>

  <!-- Comments Toggle -->
  <button @click="toggleComments(post.id)">💬</button>

  <!-- Post Comments (expandable) -->
  <PostComments
    v-if="expandedComments.has(post.id)"
    :post-id="post.id"
    @comment-added="handleCommentAdded"

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Minor Issues:

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well:

1. **Component Reusability**
   - All 8 components worked perfectly out of the box
   - No breaking changes needed
   - Clean API design paid off

2. **Type Safety**
   - TypeScript caught many potential bugs
   - Interfaces made integration smooth
   - Refactoring was safe and fast

3. **Composable Pattern**
   - useSavedPosts and useKeyboardShortcuts were easy to integrate
   - Separation of concerns worked well
   - State sharing was clean

### Challenges Faced:

1. **File Existence Checks**
   - Had to verify existing components before creating new ones
   - Many components already existed (good problem!)
   - Solution: Systematic Glob checks

2. **Template Complexity**
   - Large template made edits tricky
   - Solution: Read file sections carefully before editing

3. **CI/CD Configuration**
   - Many moving parts (8 jobs!)
   - Solution: Modular job design with dependencies

### Improvements for Next Sprint:

1. **Testing First**
   - Write unit tests BEFORE integration
   - TDD approach for new features

2. **Documentation**
   - Update docs WHILE coding
   - Don't batch documentation at end

3. **Smaller PRs**
   - Break large features into smaller chunks
   - Easier to review and merge
