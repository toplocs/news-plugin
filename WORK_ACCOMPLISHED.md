## 🔧 Component Test Adjustments Needed

The 21 failing component tests reveal:

### CleanNewsCard.vue
- May not display all metadata (reading time, difficulty)
- Topics might use different format (#tags vs badges)
- Summary truncation might have different length limit
- Glassmorphism classes might use different naming

### SkeletonCard.vue
- Animation might use different CSS approach
- Colors might use different Tailwind classes
- Size classes might be structured differently

### UnreadBadge.vue
- Doesn't cap at 9+, shows full count up to 99+
- Styling uses different CSS classes than expected
- Animation approach differs

**Next Step:** Review component implementations and update tests to match actual behavior.

## 💡 Key Insights from Testing

### What Worked Well
1. **Service-First Architecture** - All business logic is testable in isolation
2. **TypeScript** - Caught many type errors before runtime
3. **Composables** - Store logic is highly testable
4. **Mocking Strategy** - Gun.js completely mocked for predictable tests
5. **Test Organization** - Clear describe/it structure makes tests readable

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Singleton State** - Stores use module-level state that persists between tests
   - **Solution:** Clear state in beforeEach hooks
2. **Gun.js Async** - Some Gun.js operations don't return promises
   - **Solution:** Mock with immediate returns
3. **Component Implementation** - Tests revealed different implementation than expected
   - **Outcome:** Valuable feedback on actual vs. expected behavior

### Lessons Learned
1. Write tests before assuming component behavior
2. Test isolated units first, integration second
3. Mock external dependencies completely
4. Clear state between tests
5. Use descriptive test names
